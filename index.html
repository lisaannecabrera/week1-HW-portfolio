        <p> I am the youngest child of four and I have eight neices and nephews.
            They are my favorite people to be around and they are also the reason why
            I don't want children! I am from Chicago and have lived in Seattle for 10 years.
            I love to run and travel. The coolest place I've visited was Brazil for the 2014
            World Cup. The next place I want to visit is Spain and walk The Camino. The best
            thing about traveling is trying new foods and meeting the locals.
