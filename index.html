    <h2>About me</h2>
     <menu>
        <p>I moved to Seattle 10 years ago from Vegas to escape the sun and now I'm
            wishing for some of that hot sun. I have 8 neices and nephews, so I've babysat
            too many kids and dealt with too many temper tantrums. I love my job but I want more. 
            I have a great big family who are always in your business. And my favorite time 
            of year is Christmas! :)
